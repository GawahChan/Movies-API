## Movies Trailers API
This repository is used for practicing handling API calls. 

This REST API is created using github pages: https://gawahchan.github.io/Movies-API/

To get a list of Movies:
https://gawahchan.github.io/Movies-API/movies.json

To get a individual Movie:
https://gawahchan.github.io/Movies-API/movies/{uuid}.json

Anyone is welcome to use this. However, please be aware that this API is subject to change as it is for my personal use.
I've created my own API as I want to experiment with the responses for my own practice projects. You can create your own APIs very easily with github pages too: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39199042/serve-json-data-from-github-pages
